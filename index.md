# DVSA

### a Damn Vulnerable Serverless Application
Damn Vulnerable Serverless Application (DVSA) is a deliberately vulnerable application aiming to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help developers better understand the processes of securing serverless applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about serverless application security in a controlled class room environment.

The aim of DVSA is to practice some of the most common serverless vulnerabilities, with a simple straightforward interface.

Please note, there are both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as many issues as possible.

We do not take responsibility for the way in which any one uses this application (DVSA). We have made the purposes of the application clear and it should not be used maliciously. We have given warnings and taken measures to prevent users from installing DVSA on to production accounts.
